## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA)
- Service Oriented Architecture is known as a style of a software design where services are provided to the other components by application components. In addition, it also gives way to make sofware components to be reusable and interoprable. In here, each of the services is composed of the code and data integrations required to execute the specific function of the business. SOA allows it easier for software components on computers connected over a network to cooperate.

2. List and Discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Some characteristics of SOA are: 
*Interoperability - Allows services to operate and communicate with each other regardless of he platform or language is being used. 

*Composability - Services allows to be combined to achieve more complex functionality. This allows for the creation of composite applications or business processes that use multiple services.

*Discoverability - Services can be understood and discovered by others. It stores metadata in a service registry or profile documents

*Statelessness-  It doesn't store information from one session to the next. This makes them more scalable and reliable. It also supports the design of agnostic logic and improve service reuse.

*Autonomy - In here services have control over the logic they encapsulate and are developed and deployed independently. It gives increased realibility and behavioural predictability.

*Service Reusability - Services are designed to be reused. This means that a service can be used by multiple applications at the same time, which can lead to significant cost savings and increased efficiency.

*Abstraction - Services mask the complexity of their underlying reasoning. They make it easy for other services or apps to use them without being aware of the specifics of how they operate by exposing functionality while hiding the process.

*Loose Coupling - Services within SOA are loosely coupled. Wherein it means that they can operate independently of each other. This allows for greater flexibility and less dependency between different services.

*Standardized Serice Contracts - Service contract is a formal agreement between a service provider and a service consumer that outlines the functionality provided by the service. Services use service contracts in order to express their purpose and capabilities. 

3. Define Microservice
-  It is an achitectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modeled around a business domain. Microservice architecture are build up of loosely coupled, reusable and specialized components. This is usually used to build individual applications in a way that makes them more agile, scalable and resilient. With the use of Microservice, teams can update more codes easily and uses different stacks for different components.

4.List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- With the help of Microservies codes can be updated easily, teams can use diffrent stacks for different component. Addition to this, here are some addition of the benefits of using Microservices are: 
* Scalability: Microservices allow for individual services to be scaled independently based on the specific needs of the application. This means that resources can be allocated efficiently, resulting in better performance and cost optimization.
*Flexibility and Agility: Microservices enable flexibility in development and deployment. Each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, allowing for faster iterations and the ability to introduce new features or updates without impacting the entire system.
*Precise Scaling - Services can be deploye individually but can be scaled individually. 
*Container compatibility- Microservices components are suited for deployment and management within virtual containers, using well-proven container and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.
*Flexibility and Agility: Microservices enable flexibility in development and deployment. Each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, allowing for faster iterations and the ability to introduce new features or updates without impacting the entire system.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
* Similarities
	* SOA And Microservices are both considered as architectural styles that structures an application. 
	* These two architectural promotes reusability, because services that are created in here allows to be reused by different applications. 
	* It focuses on business functionality and capabilities. 
* SOA and Microservices aimâ€™s to break down application into a smaller and manageable application.
* Differences 
	* Database can share the same database while Microservice has its own database. o SOA performs large related task in contrast Microservice only performs single task.


6. Define Web Services
 - A web services is a type of a software system design that allows an interaction between different machines over a different networks. Wiht the help of Web Serives, applications from different sources is allowed to communicate with each other with a short period of time. In short, web services is a key to allow different components to communicate smoothly with each other. 

7. List and Discuss the benefits of using Web Services
* Reusability - If your code is exposed on a network, other application can use the exsting functionality of of your code.
* Scalability - Since services are developed and scaled independently, network protocols can be scaled up and down easily.
* Inteperobility - Web services provides a wide range of communication that results to allow different applications to talk and share data to each other. In layman's term it allows different languages to communicate with each other.
* Standardized Protocol - In order for web services to communicate with each other, web services used standardized industry-standard protocol. 
* Security - To secure the  confidentiality of a data exchanging, it uses a SSL/TLS for encryption and authentication.
* Cost-effective - It uses SOAP, to use an existing low-cost internet for web services implementation

8. List and Discuss the characteristics of Web Services 
* XML-Based - it uses XML to encode and decode data and SOAP to transport data.
* Loosely Coupled - The web service interface can change over time without revealing the ability of a client to connect with a service.
* Coarse-Grained - It allows to carry complex task. 
* Ability to be Synchronous and Asynchronous - Asynchronous allows client to help a sevice and then execute function, on the other hand Synchronous makes client to block and wait for the services to complete an operation before continuing a task. 
*Supports RPC's - It controls procedures expose an input and output parameters that a web can support.
* Support Document Exchange - It has an ability to exchange documents.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture 
* Provider - It implements the service and makes it accessible over the internet. It ensures that a web service performs it task correclty and accurate.
* Requestor - It utilizes an existing web services. It sends a XML request, and it uses the web service offered. 
* Broker - It gives an access into UDDI. It publishes a service and requestors find services and obtains information about a specific service.

10. List and Discuss the Web Services Components 
* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) - It communicates between applications and can run in any Operating System. 
* WSDL (Web Services Description Language) - It describes the functionality offered by a web services. This is a contract between service provider and consumer, allows to discuss what a service do and how it shall be called. 
* UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) - Used for describing, publishing and finding web services. 
* XML(eXtensible Markup Language) - it is a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is readable for human and machine.
* REST(Representational State Transfer) - It is used to design networked applications.
